## Projects

### [Aerial Semantic Segmentation](https://github.com/SandeepBhuiya-ui/Semantic-Segmentation-for-Aerial-Data)
![Aerial Semantic Segmentation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1037/1*flwnS_2FbxQIzioIOke-wg.png)
Semantic segmentation for aerial data is a computer vision task that involves dividing an aerial image into meaningful and distinct regions, each corresponding to a specific object or land cover class. Unlike simple object detection, semantic segmentation assigns a class label to every pixel in the image, providing a detailed understanding of the scene.

#### Objective
The primary goal is to classify each pixel in an aerial image into predefined classes such as roads, buildings, vegetation, water bodies, and other relevant land cover categories.

#### Challenges
- Varying lighting conditions, shadows, occlusions, and different scales of objects.
- Handling these challenges requires robust algorithms capable of capturing contextual information and spatial relationships.

#### Applications
- **Urban Planning**: Analyzing land use patterns, identifying infrastructure, and monitoring urban development.
- **Precision Agriculture**: Identifying crop types and health to optimize resource allocation and improve yield.
- **Environmental Monitoring**: Monitoring changes in natural landscapes.
- **Disaster Response**: Assessing damage after natural disasters by identifying affected areas and infrastructure.

#### Techniques
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Models like U-Net, SegNet, and DeepLab adapted for aerial imagery.
- **Transfer Learning**: Fine-tuning pre-trained models on large datasets for aerial data.
- **Spatial Context Modeling**: Techniques like dilated convolutions and atrous spatial pyramid pooling for large receptive fields.

### [Distracted Driver Detection](https://github.com/SandeepBhuiya-ui/Distracted-Driver-Detection)
![Distracted Driver Detection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25423296/163456776-7f95b81a-f1ed-45f7-b7ab-8fa810d529fa.png)
Driving a car is a difficult undertaking that needs your full focus. Any action that diverts the driver's attention from the road constitutes distracted driving. Numerous studies have distinguished between three basic categories of distraction: visual (driver's eyes off the road), manual (driver's hands off the wheel), and cognitive (driver's head off the task of driving).

#### Objective
The primary goal is to automatically detect distracted driving behaviors using computer vision techniques and notify drivers to reduce accidents caused by inattentive driving.

#### Challenges
- Handling diverse lighting conditions, angles, and positions of the driver.
- Distinguishing between various types of distractions accurately.

#### Applications
- **Safety Enforcement**: Enhancing in-car safety systems to alert drivers when distracted.
- **Accident Prevention**: Reducing the number of accidents caused by distracted driving through real-time alerts.
- **Insurance**: Providing data for insurance companies to assess driver behavior.

#### Techniques
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for feature extraction and classification.
- **Transfer Learning**: Reusing model weights from pre-trained models on well-known computer vision benchmark datasets.
- **Data Augmentation**: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to enhance model generalization.
